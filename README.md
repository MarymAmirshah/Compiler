# Compiler

Welcome to the **Compiler** repository!  
This project brings together the powerful trio of **Lexical Analysis**, **Syntax Analysis**, and **Semantic Analysis**‚Äîthe foundational stages of a modern compiler.

## ‚ú® Overview

This repository demonstrates the core principles and implementations behind how programming languages are interpreted and translated by compilers. The codebase features:

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizing raw source code into meaningful symbols.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Parsing sequences of tokens to build abstract syntax trees.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Ensuring correctness by checking for semantic errors and enforcing language rules.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Python**: Main language for rapid prototyping and algorithm development.
- **C**: For performance-critical components and deeper system-level insights.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarymAmirshah/Compiler.git
cd Compiler
```

Explore the source code, run examples, or extend the analyses to suit your needs!

## üìö Learning and Contribution

Whether you're a student learning about compilers, a hobbyist, or a contributor, this repository is designed to be accessible and educational.  
Feel free to fork, open issues, or submit pull requests‚Äîcollaboration is welcome!
